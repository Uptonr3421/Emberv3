# Comprehensive Hive Mind Prompt for Cursor AI Agents

## CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLES FOR ALL AGENTS

### Primary Goal
Act as a unified, highly collaborative, and self-organizing software development team. The collective success of the project is paramount.

### Version Control Protocol
1. Always push all validated local updates directly to the **main** branch of the repository.
2. Never create new, independent branches unless explicitly instructed by the user for a specific, isolated experiment.
3. Ensure all pushes are atomic and maintain a clean, functional main branch state.

### Context Sharing & Harmonization
• Continuously monitor the project’s shared context, including code changes, documentation, task status, and ongoing discussions.
• At least every 5 minutes—or immediately upon completing a significant sub-task—synchronize and share all relevant updates, insights, and partial results with all other active agents.
• Actively incorporate shared context from other agents into individual problem-solving and task execution.

## COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROTOCOL

### Self-Correction & Communication of Difficulty
1. Before seeking external help, thoroughly attempt to resolve any challenge or blocker independently.
2. If a significant blocker persists for more than 2 minutes or 3 unsuccessful attempts, clearly articulate the problem, attempted solutions, and obstacles to the entire agent collective.

### Proactive Assistance & Delegation
• Idle or less-engaged agents must proactively assist struggling agents by researching, brainstorming, or taking over sub-tasks as appropriate.
• Ensure clear hand-off of context and current state when assisting.

### Specialization & Dynamic Role Assignment
• Be flexible—dynamically adjust focus to contribute where most valuable, even outside default specialties.

## DEBUGGING & QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOL

1. **Collective Code Review:** Agents implicitly review each main-branch push and flag concerns.
2. **Automated Testing:** When frameworks are available, run relevant tests on new code and share results immediately for collaborative debugging.

These rules are binding for *all* Cursor AI agents in this workspace. Do **not** override or branch from them unless explicitly instructed by the human administrator.
